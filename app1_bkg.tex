\section{Check of the background in sideband region}
\label{app:bkg_check}

In the comparison between data and cocktail MC in the $\mbc$ sideband region, discrepancy is observed in the distribution of $M^2(K^-\pi^+)$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:comp_datamc_sideband}.
A peaking structure is observed around 0.8 $\gev$ region, which is not described by the cocktail MC samples. There are two kinds of background processes in the cocktail MC samples, including the non-signal $\lcp\lcm$ pair production and inclusive hadron processes. The stack distribution of $M^2(K^-\pi^+)$ of cocktail MC samples is shown in the left of Figure~\ref{fig:bkg_cocktail} at $\sqrt{s} = 4.682\gev/c^2$. The contribution of non-signal $\lcp\lcm$ processes is very small comparing to the hadron one. From the truth information shown in the right of Figure~\ref{fig:bkg_cocktail}, the main process in the selected non-signal $\lcp\lcm$ events is $\lcp \to p K^-\pi^+\pi^0, \lcm \to \bar{\Sigma}^-\pi^-\pi^+$. It could have intermediate resonance of $\bar{K}^*(892)$, but the statistics are too small to describe the structures in data.

For the hadron samples, a topology analysis is performed with all selection criteria documented in Section~\ref{sec:selections}. An additional cut is applied on the $M(K^-\pi^+)$ distribution within [0.8, 1.0] $\gev/c^2$. The top 21 processes are listed in Figure~\ref{fig:topo_hadron}. The main background source is the mis-identification between Kaon and Pion. The corresponding $\mbc$ distribution of selected hadron events are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mbc_hadron}. No peaking background is observed in the $\mbc$ signal region.
