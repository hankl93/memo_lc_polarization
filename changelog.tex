\section*{ChangeLog}

\subsection*{Version v1.4}
Compared to v1.3, the main changes are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item The signal MC samples for amplitude analysis is replaced by the inclusive PHSP signal MC ones, which require $\lcp \to pK^-\pi^+$ and $\lcm$ decays inclusively. All results in the analysis have been updated.
\item The introduction section is rewritten. Add new reference to BESIII measurement on $J/\psi \to \Xi^+\bar{\Xi}^-$. Add the normalization term in Equation~\ref{eq:eq_polar}.
\item The reason to the cutoff points on $\mbc$ at energy points are due to the $\Delta E$ requirements. 
\item Include all round1 comments from three referees.
\end{itemize}
