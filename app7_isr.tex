\section{Effects from Initial State Radiation}
\label{app:isr}
The transverse polarization parameters, $\alpha_0$ and $\sin\Delta_0$, are correlated to $G_E$ and $G_M$ which depends on the collision energies. The Initial State Radiation (ISR) could cause migration effects on the center-of-mass energies, especially for high energy points. The total energy of ISR gammas are checked using the PHSP signal MC samples at $\sqrt{s} = 4.918\gev/c^2$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:isr_energy}, which has a long tail to around 350 MeV. However, events with high ISR effects are highly suppressed by the $\Delta E$ and $\mbc$ requirements in the nominal analysis. The effects from ISR are estimated by varying the $\Delta E$ or $\mbc$ requirements and comparing the alternative amplitude analysis results to the nominal one.

\end{figure}

A total six alternative $\Delta E$ ($\mbc$) requirements are test, three of them are obtained by narrowing the nominal one by a fraction of 15\%, 10\% and 5\% around 0 ($m_{\lcp}$), while others are obtained by broadening by 5\%, 10\% and 15\%. With each updated $\Delta E$ ($\mbc$) requirement, the entire analysis procedure are performed to determine the transverse polarization parameters. The updated background fractions for each energy points are listed in Table~\ref{tab:bkg_frac_deltaE} and Table~\ref{tab:bkg_frac_mbc} for varied $\Delta E$ and $\mbc$ requirement windows, respectively. The amplitude analysis is performed using the updated inputs and the comparison are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:comparison_deltaE} and~\ref{fig:comparison_mBC} for $\sqrt{s} = 4.918$ and 4.950$\gev/c^2$. The maximum difference between nominal and alternative requirements are much smaller than the statistical uncertainties, which indicates the ISR effects on polarization measurement should be small.
